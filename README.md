## Using Monads to Structure Functional Programs

I have created this repository as part of my learning of Functional Programming.

The code/functions presented here were adapted from the paper _The Essence Of Functional Programming_
by Philip Wadler. You can find this paper and many others about Monads by Philip Wadler [here][1].

Most of the functions were kept unchanged, apart from introducing some wild-cards and
changing the function name `lookup` to `fetch` so to not conflict with the Prelude function.
